# Atomic-Hunter

Project made for Womxn Develop to Ubisoft Paris.
In my prototype, LIRE is the protagonist and must flee from the subatomic world obtaining energy from the very particles that he finds on his way, electrons, protons and neutrons. The idea is that he can form atoms with them and complete the periodic table while getting energy to return to his original size.
